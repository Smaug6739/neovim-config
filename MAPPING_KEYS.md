# Mapping keys

## Text
- <kbd>d</kbd> Delete the text
- <kbd>y</kbd>  Yank (copy) the text
- <kbd>p</kbd>  Paste your clipboard onto the text, replacing it
- <kbd>c</kbd>  Change the text, which deletes it and sets your cursor for typing
- <kbd>r</kbd>  Replace the text with the next character you type
- <kbd>yq/p</kbd> Search for the text elsewhere in your document

## Visual mode

- <kbd>v</kbd> (lower case v) begins regular Visual mode, and works similar to selecting text with a mouse. Use <kbd>h</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> to expand the selection left and right to include more words, and use <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> to expand the selection to the lines below and above.
- <kbd>V</kbd> (upper case v) begins linewise visual mode. This selects entire lines of text at a time. Use <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> to expand the selection up and down.
- <kbd>Ctrl+v</kbd> (lower case v) enters block visual mode. This selects text in a block format, allowing you to select parts of multiple lines without including the entire line. Use <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>l</kbd> as usual.
